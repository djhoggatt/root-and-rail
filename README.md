# Root and Rail

Root & Rail is a genetic engineering heavy western themed hopepunk setting, designed by Denver Hoggatt.

## Design Pillars

Biology first: Living systems are the default technology stack; steel supports, not replaces, the biosphere.

Low complexity, high reliability: Prefer simple, repairable mechanisms (rails, levers, windlasses) augmented by smart bio-materials.

Frontier pragmatism: Personal responsibility, mutual aid, and durable goods over disposables.

Clean by design: Energy and materials cycles close locally; waste is a design failure to fix.

Aesthetic of repair: Patches, grafts, and splices are badges of care, not flaws.

## Aesthetics

Look & feel: Dusty rail towns, sun-bleached timber, verdant living fences, bioluminescent accents at dusk.

Palette & textures: Oiled leather, chitin plates, boiled wool, polished brass, sap-amber resins.

Soundscape: Rail clatter, wind through grafted hedgerows, distant hoofbeats, soft peristaltic pumps in living homes.

## Technology Overview

Living homes (“house-trees”): Grown architecture with plumbed xylem trunks, fiber-optic phloem, and root intakes that filter stream water.

Genetically engineered horses: Fast, intelligent, self-foraging; fueled by sun-charged hay—engineered fodder that stores solar energy.

Weapons & ammo: Simple, robust firearms (revolvers, lever actions) using bio-engineered “bugs” as ammunition—hard shells, in-flight stabilization, and on-impact behavior; no electronics required.

Textiles & armor: Self-cleaning, self-mending merino from bio-sheep; auto-locking wool that fastens like velcro; weapon-resistant leather; chitin composites for heavy protection.

Infrastructure: Rails and wind; living fences (hedge-posts) that root, braid, and leaf; gravity cisterns; community cold-stores grown from hollow trunks.

## Energy & Ecology

Primary energy: Sun via photosynthetic crops and materials; supplemental wind and small-head hydro.

Cycles: Greywater back to root beds; manure to biochar; worn wool re-felted into new garments.

Managed wilds: Pollinator corridors, pest-eater guild insects, and seed-carrying birds bred to maintain trails and hedges.

## Transportation

Rails: Backbone of long-haul freight and passenger travel; towns cluster at sidings and water stops.

Mounts: Gene-horses for range, patrol, and courier duty; pack-beasts bred for harsh terrain.

Local: Boardwalks, canal drifts where terrain allows, grown footbridges over creeks.

## Weapons, Tools & Protection

Firearms: Favor low-maintenance actions; black-box electronics are rare in field kit.

Bio-ammo: Color-coded “loads” (penetrator, tangler, stunner) selected per task; biodegradable by default.

Defense: Chitin plate vests, boiled-wool gambesons, auto-locking closures for rapid don/doff.

## Economy & Trade

Value: Food security, seed stocks, textile bolts, rail access, water rights.

Currency: Metal scrip and ledger credits; in-kind contracts (seasonal wool, hay futures).

Crafts: Grafting guilds, tannery-biolabs, railwright shops, wool looms, chitin foundries.

## Everyday Life

Housing: Room “rings” grown seasonally; root intakes terminate at streams for filtration and cooling.

Clothing: Layered wool (under/base/warm/water) with auto-locking fasteners; field leathers for work.

Food: Orchard alleys, kitchen gardens, chicken-coop trees, and community bakehouses.

## Hazards & Antagonists

Ecological: Blights, invasive ferals, river-root overgrowth choking waterways.

Human: Bandits, monopolist combines seeking to enclose rails or seed-genomes.

Technical: Ammo hive collapses, mis-bred mounts, house-tree root breaches during floods.

## Sample Settlement: Aurora

Rail-side market town with living fence-posts capped in foliage.

House-trees root to the creek for water intake and cooling.

Coop-trees and orchard rows flank a central garden commons.

Rail spur, tannery-biolab, and wool hall anchor the economy.

Night watch rides gene-horses; bioluminescent way-markers line streets.

## Story & Campaign Hooks

A rail syndicate pushes a “temporary” monopoly clause on Aurora’s siding.

A new bio-ammo brood tangles instead of stuns—who switched the genome?

House-tree roots creep past the legal waterline, threatening downstream farms.

A gene-horse lineage shows emergent behaviors—accident or sabotage?

Bandits harvest living fences to sell chitin; the hedgerows are going bald.

A blight targets auto-locking wool fasteners mid-winter; repair the sheep line.

## Play/Build Guidelines

Keep it grounded: Biology solves problems first; machines fill gaps.

Embrace repair: If it breaks, the fix should be teachable at the town level.

Limit “magic”: Self-mending is slow, ammo bugs aren’t sapient, and grown structures obey biological constraints.

Visual continuity: West-era silhouettes + living materials + rail hardware.

## Quick Glossary

Auto-locking wool: Fiber that interlocks on contact; replace buttons/zips.

Bio-ammo: Engineered insects/bugs used as specialized ballistic loads.

House-tree: Grown dwelling with living plumbing and structure.

Living fence: Hedge-posts (tree/shrub hybrids) woven into durable barriers.

Sun-charged hay: Energy-dense fodder grown to store solar energy for mounts.
